      <li><strong>How can I link to different pages in my HTML?</strong></li>
      <p>You link to different pages in HTML by adding links (<a></a>). The <a> tag can have a property of href. Instead of using a normal URL in your href, you can add OTHER HTML file names. Example:</p>
      <p>     "<a href="about.html>" will link to the "About" page. <p>
      <p>You can also link to parts of your single HTML page by adding an ID selector as the value of your href. The ID selector will jump to the HTML element on your page with the ID you've given it. Example:</p>
      <p>     "<a href="#about">" will link to the HTML element (maybe a <div>) with the ID "about". </p>
      <p>     For mor information or examples, see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">this</a> website.
